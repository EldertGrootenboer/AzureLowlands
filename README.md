# Azure Lowlands

Azure Lowlands is a single day event, with tracks around Microsoft Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings, ranging from containers, data, integration to DevOps, IoT, and AI, and also provide several soft-skills and community sessions.
As one of the big public cloud providers, Microsoft is still investing heavily in PaaS services â€“ and we see significant growth in the demand for content and events. As organizers, we felt compelled to organize a PaaS focused event with local and European speakers. We wanted to bring such an event to the Netherlands, similar to small-sized events like CloudBrew (Belgium), Cloudburst (Sweden), and IglooConf (Finland). These events bring an intimate vibe and the opportunity to network with peers and speakers.

This repository contains the resources we use for organizing the event, such as social media automation and scheduling of sessions.
